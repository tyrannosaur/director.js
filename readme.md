# dTools - a Javascript wrapper for Adobe Director
   
This library attempts to wrap some of the inconsistencies and common pitfalls
of ECMAScript in Adobe Director. New functionality is also provided, such as
timers and wrapping of network requests and file i/o.

## Requirements

The only requirement is a JSON implementation. `dTools` includes the standard
one available at: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.js

## Installation

There are two choices:
1. Import the `dTools.cst` cast file into your Director project
2. Copy and paste the text of each JavaScript file into a new movie script with
   JavaScript syntax.
   
That's it!
